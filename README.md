ClickHouse is blazing fast, but understanding ClickHouse and using it effectively is a journey. The documentation is a great place to get started, and recently we have been working diligently on building an entire new collection of content to help developers, admins, architects and analysts gain the knowledge they need to successfully use ClickHouse in their projects.

Some of the highlights of the ClickHouse docs include:

- A redesigned **[Quick Start](https://clickhouse.com/docs/quick-start)** and **[Tutorial](https://clickhouse.com/docs/tutorial)** to get new users up and running quickly
- A new **[Connect a UI section](https://clickhouse.com/docs/connect-a-ui)** with guides on how to connect popular UI/BI tools to ClickHouse like Grafana, Metabase, Superset and Tableau
- A new Integrations section of guides on how to connect ClickHouse to external systems like Kafka AWS S3, PostgreSQL, MySQL, Airbyte and much more
- We are particularly excited about the new User Guides section filled with articles, tutorials and how-to guides covering all sorts of fundamental and advanced ClickHouse topics. We want users to understand important topics like how to choose a primary key, configure a replicated table, improve query performance, and lots of other helpful tips and tricks.
- The historical docs can be found in the new References section, where you will find all the technical details like a complete ClickHouse SQL reference, a explanation of the various ClickHouse data types, instructions on how to build ClickHouse from the source code, the recent changelog, and much more.

What's great about the new docs is that they are all open source, and we strongly encourage users of ClickHouse and providers of integrated platforms to contribute new articles and user guides. To contribute, simply create a pull request in the new public ClickHouse/clickhouse-docs repo. (Note that changes and contributions to the historical docs will continue to be performed in the ClickHouse/ClickHouse repo.)
